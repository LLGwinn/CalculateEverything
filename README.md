# Calculate Everything!

This app was created to make it easy to perform common calculations all in one place. No need to pull up your calculator for simple stuff, then go looking for a loan calculator somewhere else (and get hit with ads and tracking there), go to yet another site to calculate a mortgage, etc. At Calculate Everything, you just bookmark one page and do it all!

The app is currently in development, so please be patient as new functionality is added. 

Currently operational:
> **Plain old calculator**<br>
> Exactly what it sounds like - basic math functions.<br>

> **Loan calculator**<br>
> Enter principle amount, interest rate, and term, get a payment amount.

Coming soon:
>**Mortgage calculator**<br>
>Just like the loan calculator, but with options to enter taxes, insurance, and down payment.

>**Discount**<br>
> The thing you want to purchase is being offered with a discount of some percentage. What will the price be after the discount?

>**Wages**<br>
>Find out what an hourly rate comes out to annually. Or vice versa. Or how much that rate increase works out to hourly or annually.

If you have ideas for other calculations that would be handy to have on this site, please let me know!
